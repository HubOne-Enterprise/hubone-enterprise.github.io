# Provisioning

Provisioning involves the installation and configuration of <%PRODUCT_NAME%> in an existing Office 365 environment. This process is only performed once, and is used to automatically perform configuration of the SharePoint Site Collection and other items.<%PRODUCT_NAME%> requires a clean SharePoint Online Site Collection and will use the root site. 

Whilst the provisioning process does not delete files, it may change the look and feel of an existing chosen site collection, so take care when implementing it.

The following sections detail the steps to provision <%PRODUCT_NAME%>:

- **[Installation of <%PRODUCT_NAME%> Prerequisites](provisioning-installation-prereq.md)** - Step by step instructions on the installation of pre-requisites for your office 365 enviroment.
